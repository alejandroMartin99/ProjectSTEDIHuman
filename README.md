# STEDI Health Balance Analytics

## Overview

Spark and AWS Glue provide robust capabilities for processing, organizing, and refining data from diverse sources, allowing for versatile and insightful data analysis. As a key member of the STEDI Health Balance Analytics team, your role as a data engineer is pivotal in the process of harnessing data generated by STEDI's innovative health balance solutions. Your mission is to transform this raw data into a well-structured data lakehouse on AWS, empowering data scientists to build and fine-tune machine learning models for health and wellness insights.

## Project Scope

STEDI Health has been diligently working on a state-of-the-art health balance solution that encompasses the following:

- A cutting-edge health balance trainer designed to improve user balance and coordination.
- Advanced sensors embedded within the trainer, meticulously collecting data to train machine learning models for step detection.
- An accompanying mobile application that captures valuable customer information and interfaces with the trainer's sensors.

STEDI Health has garnered immense interest from millions of early adopters eagerly seeking to enhance their health and wellness through the STEDI Health Balance Trainer.

Numerous customers have already received their balance trainers, downloaded the mobile app, and embarked on their health journey to assess and improve their balance. The balance trainer operates as a motion sensor, recording object detection distances, while the mobile app leverages the smartphone accelerometer to detect motion along the X, Y, and Z axes.

The STEDI Health team aims to leverage the wealth of motion sensor data to train a real-time machine learning model for precise step detection. Throughout this endeavor, safeguarding user privacy remains paramount in determining which data can be utilized.

A subset of early adopters has generously consented to share their data for research purposes. The machine learning model's training dataset should exclusively comprise data from these consenting customers, drawing from their balance trainers and accelerometer readings.
